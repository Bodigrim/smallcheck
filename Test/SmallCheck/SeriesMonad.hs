-- | 'Series' is a `MonadLogic` action that enumerates values of a certain
-- type, up to some depth.
--
-- The depth bound is tracked in the 'SC' monad and can be extracted using
-- 'getDepth' and changed using 'localDepth'.
--
-- To manipulate series at the lowest level you can use its 'Monad',
-- 'MonadPlus' and 'MonadLogic' instances. This module provides some
-- higher-level combinators which simplify creating series.
--
-- A proper 'Series' should be monotonic with respect to the depth â€” i.e.
-- @localDepth (+1) s@ should emit all the values that @s@ emits (and
-- possibly some more).
--
-- It is also desirable that values of smaller depth come before the values
-- of greater depth.
