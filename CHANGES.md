Changes
=======

Version 0.1
-----------

The differences from 0.0 are two fixes (space-fault, output buffering),
an 'unsafe' but sometimes useful Testable (IO a) instance and additional
examples.

Version 0.2
-----------

The 'smallCheck' driver now takes an argument d and runs test series
at depths 0..d without interaction, stopping if any test fails.
The interactive variant is still available as 'smallCheckI'.  All
Prelude numeric types now have Serial instances, including floating-point
types. Serial types Nat and Natural are also defined.  Examples extended.

Version 0.3
-----------

Existential quantifiers now have unique variants for which two witnesses
are reported when uniqueness fails.  The over-generating coseries method
for functions of functional arguments has been replaced; now 'coseries'
and the 'alts<N>' family take a series argument. Test counters are
now Integers, not Ints.  Ord and Eq are now derived for the N types.
Examples extended.

Version 0.4
-----------

The module SmallCheck is now Test.SmallCheck.  Packaged with Cabal.

Version 0.5
-----------

Make the package build with GHC 7.2. Some cosmetic changes.
