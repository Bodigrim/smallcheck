First see ../../README.

This directory gives the largest illustrative example.  We test for
congruence between an interpreter and compiler for a small imperative
language.  The example is adapted from an original using QuickCheck,
as described in the lecture notes for AFP'02 (LNCS 2638).  Compared
with the simpler example in ../logic, here specialised instances
are used to restrict the input space to programs in a standard form.
Run Properties.main and compare the rate of growth for the last two
properties tested.
