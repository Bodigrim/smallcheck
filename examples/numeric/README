First see ../../README.

In this directory, NumProps.hs illustrates the use of test series
for natural numbers, either by explicit signatures including Nat (or
Natural) or by use of the N constructor.  It also illustrates use of
floating-point series. Compile or interpret NumProps (SmallCheck is
the only other module required) and run main for a small selection of
self-introducing tests -- a couple about natural numbers and primes,
and a couple about floating point numbers.
