First see ../../README.

In this directory, NumProps.hs illustrates the use of test series
for natural numbers, either by explicit signatures including Nat (or
Natural) or by use of the N constructor.  It also illustrates use of
floating-point series. Compile or interpret NumProps (SmallCheck is
the only other module required) and run main for a small selection of
self-introducing tests -- a couple about natural numbers and primes,
and a couple about floating point numbers.

For version 0.3 the second property about primes has been strengthened
by making the existence unique.  The restriction on the exponent list
was prompted by reports of non-uniqueness when the 'exists1' version
was first tested.
